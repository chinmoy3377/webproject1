            <p>Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive.</p>
            <p>What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.</p>
            <p>Friends and money - oil and water. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. When they come... they come at what you love. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen.</p>

            <h3>What We Do?</h3>
            <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment.</p>
